# Paper model of Kaleidocycle

## Paper Plan

- [K7](paper-K7.pdf): Mobius Kaleidocycle with 7 tetrahedra
- [K8](paper-K8.pdf): Mobius Kaleidocycle with 8 tetrahedra
- [K9](paper-K9.pdf): Mobius Kaleidocycle with 9 tetrahedra
- Paper plans for Kaleidocycles with 10 or more tetrahedra can be obtained by [Maple code](../Kaleidocycle.mw)

## How to make

1. Cut along the outer boundary
2. The triangles in the right-most column and the bottom row are the glue allowance
3. Each row makes a tetrahedron
4. Crease every line firmly before folding tetrahedra
5. Horizontal lines should be creased in both mountain and valley and others in mountain
6. Apply some glue on the face of the gluing triangles
7. Fold tetrahedra from the top row
8. Insert the two gluing triangles at the bottom row into the tetrahedron corresponding to the first row
