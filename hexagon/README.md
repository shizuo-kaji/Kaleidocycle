# Paper model of Hexaflexagon

Hexaflexagon is a two-dimensional cousin of Kaleidocycle that turns to reveal different faces.
This directory contains a paper model of a hexaflexagon with a world-map printed on it.
Each portion of the world is mapped to a hexagon by preserving angles (that is, conformally) using the Schwarz-Christoffel mapping.
It is designed by Lai Hsin-Yu and Kai-Hsiang Wang during [NCTS Undergraduate Summer Research Program 2018](https://ncts.ntu.edu.tw/news_detail.php?nid=59).
